# learn react by getting weather and a word

Use API, offered by Wordnik and OpenWeather dot com to create a neat graphics on screen. Use react. Should be a piece of cake. A walk in the park.

## v.0

- show fewer words on screen
  - cycle through the list instead of writing all of the words to the DOM.
  - then use React to load in the next set of words.

- make a function that takes in data from the two APIs (or more) and spit out an object or an array that can be consumed by functions that do stuff (Por ejemplo: redraw `<svg>` graphics, shapes, text etc. in the DOM)

- find opportunities for interactivity
  - animation
  - using native controls
    - sliders, form controls etc. / et al
