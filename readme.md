## v.0.1

- React in the mix

## v.0

- Use React on this project

  - why? ✅
    - need to be employable. There, thats it. The react side of the force surrounds us...
    - All library / framework shin kicking aside. I like learning new stuff.
  - how? ✅
    - the usual ways, npm install and all that jazz
    - then using it via module imports etc, started w/ referencing from script tags but now its time put on my "big boy pants" as it were, and just for the good ol infantilizing self dig...

- Show fewer words on screen

  - cycle through the list instead of writing all of the words to the DOM.
  - then use React to load in the next set of words.

- Make a function that takes in data from the two APIs (or more) and spit out an object or an array that can be consumed by functions that do stuff (Por ejemplo: redraw `<svg>` graphics, shapes, text etc. in the DOM)

- Be more creative w/ the API data being fetched

  - Wind speed could control animation timings / speeds
  - Do more with the words from Wordnik

- Find opportunities for interactivity

  - animation
  - using native controls
    - sliders, form controls etc. / et al
      - font sizes
      - colors
      - positions

- Do something more interesting with the text ✅

- start using some data from the apis ✅

  - wind is used by a gradient ✅

- hook up the apis ✅

  - weather api ✅
  - wordnik ✅

- convert text to svg text and print to screen ✅

- set up environment to secure api keys etc. ✅
